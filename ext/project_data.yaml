summary:  'TorqueBox is a Ruby/JBoss application application platform'
description: |
  TorqueBox is a new kind of Ruby application platform that supports popular
  technologies such as Ruby on Rails and Sinatra, while extending the
  footprint of Ruby applications to include built-in support for services such
  as messaging, scheduling, caching, and daemons.
  
  TorqueBox provides an all-in-one environment, built upon the latest JBoss AS
  Java application server and JRuby. Functionality such as clustering,
  load-balancing and high-availability is included right out-of-the-box.
  
  This package of TorqueBox is intended for use with the Razor server, but has
  no modifications from the stock TorqueBox, and is used under their license.
